Replication of a bug we encountered while developing a CLR profiler.
In this example, we can see that two instances of a generic class Plugin.MyGenList`1 are loaded (for System.__Canon and System.String) and two are Unloaded (one is System.__Canon, the other is unknown - module already unloaded). The unknown and System.String instances have 2 different ClassIDs.
