Replication of a bug we encountered while packaging a netcoreapp3.1 self-contained application in linux.
In this example, we use .net core sdk 3.1 to publish using /p:PublishTrimmed=true, once with /p:PublishSingleFile=true and once without.
Running the 2 executables on the provided exe gives different outputs.
